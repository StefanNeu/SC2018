# SC2018testing
Welcome to the GitHub Supcrafted repository!
Here you can find the structure of this repository and of the unity-project itself.

The repository has two folders at the moment:  
BlenderProjects stores a few .blend and .fbx files that are used in the project and
SC2018 is the actual Unity-project.
